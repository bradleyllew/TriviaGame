        <!-- WHAT REMAINS TO BE COMPLETED -->
        <!-- I understand how to do a form, and radio buttons, and I think they would be easy to implement if 
        I had my questions hardwired in the HTML:
        <input type="radio" name="same" value="whatev"> Choice One<br>
        <input type="radio" name="same" value="something"> Choice Two<br>
        <input type="radio" name="same" value="somethingEles"> Choice Three<br>

        The above would be wrapped in a <div class="form"> tag
        The input type="radio" would form the actual button type
        The name would remain the same, so the answer choices would be in the same group
        User could only select one radio button at a time

        I couldn't figure out how to add these to my external question sheet???
        I had already picked the styling, and have left it in the css, as it doesn't effect anything at the moment :(
        Attempted 'radio' function at bottom of question sheet

        Also...This has somehow now become a hybrid of the 2 assignments, I guess???  Still needs reset button 
        and may attempt to add alerts at some point one the bugs get ironed out :)
        THIS WAS REALLY HARD!!!!!!
